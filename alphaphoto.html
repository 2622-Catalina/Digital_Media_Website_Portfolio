<p><strong>Alphabet Photography:</strong></p>
	        	    	<p>My name was given to me by my parents not only because it was my great-grandmother's, but also because it means “pure” in Spanish and they wanted to give me a name that would guide me to opportunities and possibilities. As a family, we all believe that words and actions have power, which is another reason why they chose that name, for me to be able to see the world as it is and not be deceived by people with ill-intentions.</p>
