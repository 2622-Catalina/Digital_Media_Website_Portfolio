<p><strong>Logo:</strong></p>
  <p>My logos depict my name surrounded by symbols or other drawings. Additionally, there are several different colors in some of the logos, which show the color variety of happiness and comfort. The white background helps the viewer focus on the actual logo while keeping everything professional. Moreover, the simpleness of all the logos create an aesthetically pleasing perspective. Adobe Illustrator was a very frustrating application. It lacks some of the necessary features that Adobe Photoshop had to make things more approachable. Also, Adobe Illustrator didnâ€™t have the feature of Object Selection, which would have made my life much easier when creating the Mood Board based logo. Furthermore, I hope to use a different application on my next project and be able to successfully render my next project with quality instead of the difficulty I faced with Adobe Illustrator.</p>
