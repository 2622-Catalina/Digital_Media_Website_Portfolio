<p><strong>No-Face Self Portrait:</strong></p>
	<p>In the fall and the winter, I feel like the world has been suspended in time and everything is cold, calm, and more relaxed. I like that and it calms me down. Even though my project does seem a little crazy, with all the different colors and shapes, the beauty is in the chaos. As a student who loves reading, and will read any book, I put books on the border to represent that they enclose my being. I kept the original background of the flower the same because it didn’t need anything added to it, along with the picture of my dog (which I cropped) shows how much she means to me and is part of my core personality. Additionally, the car in the fall background shows my love for taking pictures of cars that I like, whether they’re on the street or somewhere else, I add them to a collection. Also, I LOVE coffee and macarons, so I added those too in order to represent them as a part of me. Lastly, my love for music is shown through a song cover that started my adoration of Brazilian music.</p>
